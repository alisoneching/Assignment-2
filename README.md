# Assignment-2
#2. read the training files, test them, and output the performance on the test set contact_lens_test.csv
#3e. read the file email_classification.csv and compute the LOO-CV error rate for a 1NN classifier on the spam/ham classification task
#5b. read the file weather_training.csv and output the classification of each of the 10 instances form the file weather_test if the classification confidence is >= 0.75

To run this code:

1. Make sure python and csv files are in the same directory.
2. Open terminal and navigate to the directory with both the python and csv files.
3. For #2, run 'python3 decision_tree_2.py'
4. For #3e, run 'python3 knn.py'
5. For #5b, run 'python3 naive_bayes.py'
